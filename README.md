# spindication
Spinndication is an application made by DJs for DJs. It is intended to help DJ's answer the question that comes up in every set "What was that one song I played after this one that people went crazy for?"

## design
The design idea is to create a simple recommender system by storing order tracks from a setlist as nodes in a graph database. Once this database is well formated and accurate, finding the "next" song should be as easy as querying for edges of the playing song.

## status
Currently development of this project is on hold likely until I DJ enough times in the summer of 19' to want to hack together an MVP. 

## about me / contributing
You can check out some [bullet points](https://johnosberg.gitlab.io/) about me, which will also lead to all of my social accounts, feel free to internet creep. 

Since this project has stalled out, if you somehow stumble on this code feel free to reach out about contributing, or just fork it and run with it. If you make something cool from the idea I'd love it if you reach out, I'll probably want to use it!
